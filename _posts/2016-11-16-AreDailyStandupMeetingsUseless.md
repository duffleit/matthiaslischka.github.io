title: Are daily standup meetings useless?

Agile is cool. Standups are agile. Standups are cool. Right?
In fact, standups are one of the biggest agile anti pattern - if you are not aware.

If you know nothing about agile you still know daily standup meetings. That's what throws your team from boring waterfall to fashionably agile - apparently. Its the first thing you learn at every scrum, kanban and agile training and for many of us it was the only thing we took out of it at first. In fact, it seems like a really good idea and it's anyway just like 10 minutes a day - so why not try it? [Just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0).
I know standups for at least 8 years now and I'm doing standups ever since then. But let's just take a step back and rethink the idea behind the daily standup meeting.

## Three questions

* What did I accomplish yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What obstacles are impeding my progress?

### What did I accomplish yesterday?
Why do you ask? What's not clear? I moved my tasks on the taskboard, I pushed a bunch of new tests to the dev branch, all speaking loud and clear about what's going on, and moreover, we just talked about that in the task planning and now it's done. Next.

### What will I do today?
I will do what I am assigned for on the taskboard right now. I will do the next thing according to the priority afterwards. The blocked thing is blocked for a reason. Read the details if you really wanna know - dont waste everyones time because you spotted a red "x" (or whatever).

### What obstacles are impending my progress?
The obstacles I have been talking about to the people who can help me the whole day so far.

## The three antipatterns
My biggest concern about the standup and the three questions is, that they are used as a compensation for a bad development process. The most important tool in an agile project is a decent taskboard. Physical or digital, it has to be able to tell at a glance what is done, what is open and what is in progress at the moment. The DEVs should see who is coding what and who is testing what. The testers should see what is ready for testing and what is done for good. The POs should be able to see which stories are ready for demonstration and the PM should not use the taskboard at all. Consequently, if you are interested in any of the three questions from above - just take a look on your own.

Nobody should wait for the standup in order to take a new task or point out an issue. I have seen this in the past over and over again and that's a real problem. Whenever you need a new task you should be able to just take the next one according to priority. Whenever you are confronted with an issue tackle it right away and talk to whoever you need to talk to. If you don't know who to talk to ask someone - don't waste time waiting because the standup meeting is scheduled for next day morning. Communication all the time.

## Benefits of standups
So why are daily standups still a big thing? Because they can tell you a lot about how you function as a team and how healthy your development process is. When the daily standup meeting is something your team values you should take the next step and investigate why. What are the problems your team solves in the standup? Is the standup really the best place to solve that problem? Is the taskboard as functional as it should be? Is your team communication on the right level? Are tasks clear enough that anyone could start any of them anytime? Are problems detected and tackled the earliest possible?
Every new team usually values the daily standups for a good reason. There is a lot of uncertainty and the standup serves as a safety net. You just need to be aware of that in order to get the biggest benefit out of it. Do not just do it because scrum wants you to! Do, review, improve. And maybe at some point your team will come to the conclusion that they don't need standups every day.

The biggest benefit of the daily standup is its smell detection. Agile development should not be a dogma. Being agile is all about adapting your development process to fit your needs - all the time.
